aiflowers (processing + kinect)
===============================

This is a self initiated project in response to Ai Weiwei's aiflowers.org. I felt using motion to draw aiflowers in public places is a great way to spread the message - respect life, never forget. 

Simple-openni is required(https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/), oscP5(http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) is only needed if you choose to use an external OSC controller.

Feel free to share, and do whatever you want with/to it. 

Respect life, never forget.
